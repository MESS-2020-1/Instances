# Instances

This repository stores the instances used for the [MESS-2020+1 competition](https://www.ants-lab.it/mess2020/#competition).

The directory [`Public`](Public) contains instances `wlp01`-`wlp20` which were published at the announcement of the competition. The directory [`Hidden`](Hidden) contains instances `wlp21`-`wlp30` that were used to compare the solvers, and they were not provided to the participants until the conclusion of the competition. The instance `toy` is meant for testing and debugging. Instances are written in MiniZinc format. Note: largest instances are zipped due to file size issues on github.
